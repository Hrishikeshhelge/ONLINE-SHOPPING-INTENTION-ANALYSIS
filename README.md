# ONLINE-SHOPPING-INTENTION-ANALYSIS
#### The growing popularity of online shopping has led to the emergence of new economic activities. To be successful in a highly competitive eCommerce environment, it is essential to understand customers’ online purchase intent.
#### In recent years, e-commerce has brought huge benefits to suppliers and consumers. Defined as the use of the Internet to sell products or services to individual consumers, e-commerce has profoundly changed the way people conduct their business.
#### Indeed, it has become an important full-fledged transaction channel. A recent survey of online shopping predicted that the total amount of direct sales to customers will exceed $ 240 billion by 2007. Major technological innovations in online shopping have changed transaction channels in the information age.
#### With the growth of online shopping, it has become important to understand the factors that influence a consumer’s intention to buy from a website rather than just browse. This emerging topic is of interest to both academics and machine learning practitioners.
